The motivation behind this project:



Many individuals struggle to choose the right diet due to a lack of nutritional knowledge, health conditions, or lifestyle factors. Poor dietary choices can lead to serious health issues such as obesity, diabetes, and heart disease, making personalized nutrition guidance essential. However, most available diet plans offer generalized recommendations that may not suit everyoneâ€™s specific needs.

This project aims to develop an AI-powered diet recommendation system that provides personalized meal plans based on a limited set of key inputs: age, BMI, daily calorie intake, gender, health condition, and activity level. By utilizing machine learning, the system classifies users into appropriate diet categories and offers tailored meal recommendations to help them make healthier food choices.

We chose this project because of its direct impact on health and wellness. Instead of relying on one-size-fits-all diet plans, this system ensures data-driven, user-specific dietary suggestions, making healthy eating more accessible, practical, and effective. Additionally, integrating AI into nutrition planning aligns with advancements in health-tech solutions, offering a smart and efficient way to improve individual dietary habits.
